# Smart Contract Risks

Our smart contract code has been written by a team of senior software engineers and will not launch on mainnet until we complete two comprehensive audits with reputable independent firms. Nonetheless, the larger our codebase, the more attack vectors. To mitigate this risk we will maintain a healthy bug bounty and require at least two new, independent, and publicly-published contract audits prior to upgrading any of our contracts. Eventually upgradability will be removed entirely.&#x20;
