At launch there will be the risk that a government or corporate actor may disrupt services by disabling services that Mimicry depends on for hosting front-end web assets and blockchain relayer nodes. In time this risk will eventually be mitigated with the use of private relayer nodes, decentralized file storage, an unstoppable domain, and censorship-resistant oracles.
