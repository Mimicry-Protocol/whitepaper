# Macroeconomic Risk

Participants who deposit non-stable collateral, including $MIMIC, are at risk of having their position sizes reduced due to changes in the value of their underlying collateralized assets. This risk will remain present in perpetuity as we believe that it benefits Actors and Producers who are bullish on certain non-stable assetsâ€”including $MIMIC. Additionally, by not forcing players to use stable assets we remove unwanted slippage or impermanent losses that they may have otherwise incurred.
