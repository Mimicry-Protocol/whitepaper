# Balancer Shortage Risk

Early in the life of the protocol there may be a shortage of Balancers who compete to earn tips. To offset this risk, the Mimicry Foundation and several key partners will run Balancer nodes. Dockerized source code for running a balancer node will be open source and made available to anyone who wishes to compete for tips.
