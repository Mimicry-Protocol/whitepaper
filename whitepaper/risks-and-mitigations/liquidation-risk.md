# Liquidation Risk

A situation may occur where a playerâ€™s position is worth less than zero. For example, this may be the case for bearish Mime when the reference-price of a Pantomime more than doubles. In these cases the winning side will have rights to all tokens held by the losing position, but no more than that ceiling. The losing Actor will not owe the winners any additional funds and their Mime will effectively be worthless.&#x20;
