# ‚è∞ Automations

Actors and Producers will have the opportunity to define a series of automated position management settings that work in concert with each other, and with leverage. Automations will be maintained by Balancers and paid for by tips specified by players. Players offering the highest tips will have their positions automated before other players offering lower tips.
