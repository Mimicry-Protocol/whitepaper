### How Data Flows

Players may take positions by selecting a number of variables and depositing collateral. New positions are represented as ERC-721 tokens (Mimics).&#x20;

### Mimics as NFTs

Each minted Mimic will contain specialized metadata written to the blockchain. When rendered within a wallet, that data, along with real-time performance information, will be visible in the NFT itself. Some of the data recorded may include:

* The NFT collection to peg value against, including chain ID and contract address
* The direction of the collection's market-cap price prediction (up or down)
* The type of ERC-20 collateral deposited, including chain ID and contract address
* The amount of deposited collateral, in USD terms
* The USD liquidation value of the position, after fees
* The amount of profit, expressed as a percentage
* The amount of paper profit, in USD terms
* The amount of time the position has been open

For the purposes of illustration, we imagine combining the Uniswap v3 LP token design with a posterize filter applied to a randomly selected asset from whatever collection happens to be pegged by the metadata.&#x20;

### **Minting Mimics**

Participants can mint a Mimic by depositing ERC-20 collateral into the Mimicry Pool smart contract. The steps involved with minting are:

* The Pool contract checks that the collection meets certain safety standards
* Collateral is added to the Collateral Pool
* With the collateral assigned to the depositor, the Pool contract instructs the Mimic contract to issue the new NFT. It's metadata reflects the deposit and is added to the depositor's wallet

### **Claiming Fees**

When Mimics are burned through the Mimicry contract, a small fee is extracted and sent to the fee pool to be claimed by $MIME depositors. When claiming fees, a depositor also claims their $MIME depositing rewards, which reward them with extra $MIME for depositing the $MIME they currently have. The smart contracts' process once a depositor requests to claim their fees is as follows:

* The fee pool checks whether there are fees currently available and whether the depositor is eligible to receive fees.
* The amount of fees in USDm is sent to the depositor's wallet address and the balance of the fee pool is updated.
* Additionally, a pro-rata amount of escrowed $MIME is assigned to the wallet address from the $MIME depositor rewards contract.

Fees are allocated based on the proportion of debt each depositor has issued. For example, if a depositor has issued 1,000 USDm in debt, the debt pool is 10,000 USDm, and 100 USDm in fees are generated in a fee period, this depositor is entitled to 10 USDm because their debt represents 10% of the debt pool. The same proportional distribution mechanism is used for $MIME depositor rewards.

### **Burning Debt**

When a $MIME depositor wants to exit the system or reduce their debt and unlock deposited $MIME, they must pay back their debt. At its simplest: a depositor mints 10 USDm by locking $MIME as collateral, and must burn 10 USDm to unlock it. But if the debt pool fluctuates (and therefore their individual debt fluctuates) while they are deposited, they may need to burn more or less debt than they minted. The process for reducing debt to zero is as follows:

* The Mimicry contract determines their debt balance and removes them from the Debt Register.
* The required amount of USDm is burned, and total supply of USDm is updated along with the USDm balance in the userâ€™s wallet.
* Their $MIME balance becomes transferrable.

### **The Debt Pool**

The system tracks the debt pool (as well as each individual depositor's debt) each time a $MIME holder mints or burns Mimics. It does this by updating the Cumulative Debt Delta Ratio. This measures the $MIME depositorâ€™s proportion of the debt pool at the time they last minted or burned, as well as the debt change caused by other depositors entering or leaving the system. The system uses this information to determine the individual debt of each depositor at any time in the future, without having to actually record the changing debt of each individual depositor.

Updating the Cumulative Debt Delta Ratio on the Debt Register allows the system to track every userâ€™s % of the debt. It calculates the % change the new debt introduces against the debt pool using the formula below and appends it to the Debt Register:

`New Debt Minted (Total Existing Debt + New Debt)`

The depositor's last mint/burn action is then recorded in the Debt Register within their issuance data and the relative index number at which this action happened. The detail recorded is the percentage of the debt pool they represent, which is calculated by this formula:

`User debt percentage == (New Debt + Existing Debt) (Previous Debt Pool + New Debt)`

The Debt Register holds the Cumulative Debt Delta Ratio, which is the product of the calculation above, and the relative time (index) the debt was added, so that it can be used to calculate any userâ€™s % of the debt pool at any index in the future based on the % shift in the debt pool their last mint/burn caused.

The debt pool is recalculated by summing the number of tokens in each Mimic contract multiplied by the current exchange rates, each time new debt is issued/burned:

`totalDebtIssued == totalIssuedMimics`

This enables the calculation of the current debt pool, and is included in the updated Cumulative Debt Delta Ratio so that we know at each Debt Register entry the size of the debt (in Mimics).

When a depositor pays back their debt (i.e. by burning the Mimics they minted) to unlock their $MIME collateral the system updates the Cumulative Debt Delta based on the % shift in the amount of debt to be burned against the total value of the systemâ€™s debt after the reduction in debt.

This is the inverse calculation from when a user mints new debt:

`user's new debt percentage == (existing debt - debt to be burned) (debt pool - debt to be burned)`

This is the formula for calculating the updated Cumulative Debt Delta:

`delta == debt to be burned (debt pool - debt to be burned)`

If a depositor burns all their debt, their issuance data in the Debt Register will be set to 0 and they will no longer be part of the debt pool.

### **The Oracle**

The value of all mimic assets in the Mimicry protocol are currently determined by oracles that push price feeds on-chain. It uses an algorithm with a variety of sources to form an aggregate value for each asset. The price feeds are currently supplied by both Chainlinkâ€™s independent node operators and Mimicry, and eventually will be entirely supplied by a decentralized oracle such as Chainlink.
