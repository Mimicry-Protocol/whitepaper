# Automated Take-Profit

Mime’s that have a take-profit set will harvest profits when a certain amount of profits are earned due to changes in the reference-price of a Pantomime.&#x20;

> **For example:** <mark style="color:purple;">If Charlie sets a take-profit of 15% for his bullish Mime, then his position’s at-risk liquidity will automatically be reduced to its original value whenever the Pantomime reference-price moves up by 15%. Simultaneously his 15% profits will be safely harvested and available to him when he closes his position—regardless of what may have happened to the reference price after that point.</mark>
