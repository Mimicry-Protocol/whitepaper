# Automated Stop-Loss

Mimeâ€™s that have a stop-loss set will automatically close when a certain amount of deposited capital is lost due to changes in the reference-price of a Pantomime.&#x20;

> **For example:** <mark style="color:purple;">If Bob opens a bullish long position with $100 worth of collateral, and he sets a stop-loss of 20%, then his position will close automatically whenever the Pantomime reference-price moves down such that his losses, including his exit fee and Balancer tip, are equal to $20.</mark>
