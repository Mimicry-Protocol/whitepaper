# ðŸ‘· Crew (Team)

The last but not least group of players in our game are the creators of the game itself. Crew is motivated to build an unstoppable game that helps anyone discover the odds of any market, safely and privately. Crew exchanges time, knowhow, and capital for the prospect of spiritual, legacy, and economic reward.&#x20;

Crew collaborate as members of a decentralized autonomous organization and are appointed by the community of players via token-holder voting mechanics.&#x20;

> **Crew have a concrete directive to:** <mark style="color:purple;">create open-source smart contracts and player-friendly interfaces that allow anyone to easily and safely interact with Pantomimes and Mimes for countless years to come.</mark>
