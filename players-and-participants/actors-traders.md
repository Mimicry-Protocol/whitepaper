# ðŸŽ­ Actors (Traders)

The next subset of players in our game are the bulls and bears, or a group we call Actors. Actors are motivated by a desire for profits, and they hope to earn profits based on their fundamental belief that a Pantomimeâ€™s reference price will be higher or lower in the future.&#x20;

Actors will deposit capital to open Mimes in Pantomimes where they have emotional affinity, or where they believe the current skew of capital spread between the bulls and the bears presents favorable odds on one side. Accordingly, as Actors open positions, they help to discover the True Odds for each side of a given market.
