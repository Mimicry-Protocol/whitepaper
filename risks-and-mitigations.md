# ⚠ Risks & Mitigations

### **Current risks**

There are several risks in the current architecture, as Mimicry is still an experimental system and complex systems require both empirical observations and theoretical analysis. Empirical observation and theoretical analysis ensure the mechanism design aligns incentives for all players.

One risk involves the debt MIMIC holders issue when they deposit their MIMIC and mint Mimics. As previously explained, this debt can fluctuate due to exchange rate shifts within the system. This means that to exit the system and unlock their deposited MIMIC, they may need to burn more Mimics than they originally minted.

Most people in the cryptocurrency space are aware of this risk, but the prices of most crypto assets are highly correlated to Bitcoin. This means it’s possible for major price fluctuations in the MIMIC token to occur for reasons that have little to do with MIMIC or the Mimicry system.

Another risk involves a bad actor minting a new Mimic and then manipulating the floor price of an NFT collection that they solely control on OpenSea. This risk can be mitigated by restricting Mimic minting to those collections that have a certain amount of sales volume, or unique wallet addresses, or unique tokens listed for sale, etc.

Finally, there are a number of aspects of the system that are currently centralized. This decision has been made to ensure efficient implementation of the project. One example of centralization is the use of proxy contracts for NFT collection floor price discovery. This is to ensure the system can be upgraded easily but confers a level of control to the engineering team which requires trust from users. While these aspects will be phased out over time, it is important to understand the risks inherent in the current system architecture.
