# ðŸŽ² The Trading Game

### It's Sort of Like Fantasy Football

Mimicry's trading game can be quite confusing to people unfamiliar with pooled collateral models, so we've created an illustration using a modified version of fantasy football.&#x20;

Suppose the game you're playing with 10 friends goes like thisâ€¦

* Each player deposits $100 worth of ERC-20 collateral.
* Each player picks one NFL quarterback per week over the course of a 16-week season. Players can change their quarterback selection anytime.
* Each week we'll keep track of how many yards the selected quarterback runs for, where lost yards from sacks count against the run total. So a quarterback could have positive or negative running yards each week)
* When selecting their quarterback, each player also must designate if they want to use the actual yards ran, or the inverse of the actual yards ran.
* The player who tallies the greatest number of combined yards wins first place. The player who tallies the least number of combined yards wins last place. The other players are stack-ranked in between.
* The $1,000 prize pool is split in a way that allows the top five players to earn gains. Those gains are paid for from the bottom five players' deposited collateral.

### Fantasy NFT Collections

Now suppose instead of the football game above, your aim is to select the NFT collection that will be accelerating in price the fastest during any period of time. Or the collection that is decelerating the fastest, if you happened to pick the inverse position. Your earned rewards will be a function of your ability to swap between NFT collections as their percentage-based gains speed up or slow down, much like trying to pick the fastest horse in a race at any given time.

The main difference between the fantasy football example above and Mimicry is that with Mimicry (a) players can open or close positions at any time, (b) positions must be collateralized with more conservatively than 1:1, (c) deposited collateral value will change in USD-terms depending on the macro price movement of the deposited collateral, and (d) winnings are not linearly distributed.

### The Shared Debt Pool, Explained

Most people are familiar with order books, or trading systems with counterparties who are willing to only buy specific assets.&#x20;
