# ðŸª™ $MIME Tokenomics

### How Mimics Work

A Mimic is an ERC-721 token that represents a person's deposited ERC-20 collateral, long or short position-choice on a particular NFT collection, and other basic metadata. As the value of the deposited collateral goes up or down with the macroeconomic market factors, the value of the Mimic changes. As the appraised value of the NFT collection the Mimic is pegged to changes, the value of the Mimic changes.&#x20;

### Why Deposit $MIME

$MIME holders are incentivized to deposit their tokens and mint Mimics in several ways.&#x20;

Firstly, there are exchange revenue rewards. Closing any position generates an exchange fee that is sent to a fee pool. These rewards can be redeemed by $MIME holders each week.

The other incentive for $MIME holders to deposit is $MIME depositing rewards, which comes from the protocolâ€™s community rewards. 25% of the total $MIME token supply will be distributed to $MIME depositors weekly, on a pro-rata basis, for the first 48 months from the launch of the $MIME token on Polygon's mainnet, provided they are holding Mimic'd USD. Tokens will be released on a curve, so the earliest depositors receive the most rewards.
