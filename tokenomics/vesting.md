### **Investors and Crew**

Pre-Product Investors will receive 10% of their $MIMIC tokens at the TGE, and their remaining tokens will be streamed linearly over the next 24 months.&#x20;

Post-Product Investors have notably less risk than Pre-Product Investors, so they will receive 10% of their $MIMIC tokens at the TGE, and the remaining tokens will be streamed linearly over the next 36 months. Post-Product Investors will also have a contractual mandate to only use their vested tokens during the first 12 months following the TGE for providing liquidity to the protocol within Mimes.&#x20;

Crew will receive 10% of their tokens at the TGE, and their remaining tokens will be streamed linearly over the next 36 months.&#x20;

### **Community**

The Mimicry Foundation will receive their tokens via a linear stream over the 60 months following the TGE. Tokens granted to market makers will be fully-vested at the time of the grant in exchange for long-term contractual agreements for market-making services. Claimed community rewards and airdrop tokens will vest linearly over the 12 months following their minting by members of the community.

In no particular order or ratio, we anticipate that the majority of the earliest recipients of vested $MIMIC will operate as Producers to provide liquidity to the protocol and earn rewards, or (b) deposit their $MIMIC within LP pools on decentralized exchanges to earn trading fees.
