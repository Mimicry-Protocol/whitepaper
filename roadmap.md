# ðŸ—“ Roadmap

### Mimicry Protocol

Our MVP smart contracts will be live on the Mumbai testnet in April 2022.&#x20;

### Mimicry Dapp MVP

Once the Mimicry smart contracts are ready for testing we'll release our consumer platform. This platform will be initially optimized for simplicity and ease of use, and specifically user-tested with personas that are NFT-native. MVP features may include:

* Ability to connect MetaMask wallet
* Mechanism to select NFT collection, select long or short, deposit USDC, and mint a Mimic
* Mechanism to view collateral balances
* Mechanism to burn Mimics and release deposited collateral

### Non-Exhaustive Potential Product Expansion

Support forâ€¦

* NFT collections on Solana, BSC, Polygon, and others
* More ERC-20s beyond USDC
* Yield-farming of deposited assets
* Decentralized governance
* Increasing/decreasing positions without closing them
* Swapping Mimics
* Loans against Mimics
* Support for new asset classes beyond NFT collections
* Mimic baskets for asset managers, akin to TokenSets or dHedge
